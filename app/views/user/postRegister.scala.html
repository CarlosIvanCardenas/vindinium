@(user: User)

<h1>@user.name successfully registered</h1>

<p>
  This your user key: <strong>@user.key</strong>.

  Keep it secret. You will need it as an API parameter
  to authenticate your AI with the server.

  If you forget your key, you're screwed. There is no recovery.

  Copy the key, then <a href="@routes.User.show(user.id)">Proceed to your user page</a>.
