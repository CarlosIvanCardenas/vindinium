            First, be sure to join the #vindinium IRC chan on Freenode if you have any questions or if you want to geek around a little bit. Here is a <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=vindinium">direct link for people who don't have an IRC client</a>.

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>Vindinium is a multi-player turn based dungeon crawling game. Each player has one hero that can move across a map. The objective is for players to amass the maximum quantity of gold during a predetermined number of turn. Players must take control of gold mines to produce gold; however, gold mines are protected by goblins. When a player defeats a goblin, he becomes owner of the gold mine and receives one gold per turn. Furthermore, the goblin now defends the mine against other players.</p>

            <p>Heroes can fight each other. The survivor gets control of all his opponent's gold mines. The killed hero is immediatly respawned with all his gold, but no mine.</p>

            <p>When going to the tavern, heroes can buy beers for gold, restoring their life points.</p>

            <p>The objective is to create a computer program (a bot) that plays the game of Vindinium as intelligently as possible. It is recommended that you use one of the <a href="@routes.App.starters()">starter packages</a> as a starting point.</p>

            <h3>Maps</h3>

            <p>Maps are generated randomly. Each element of the map is coded using 2 character. Here is an example:</p>

            <p>Generated maps are symmetric, and always contain 4 taverns and 4 heroes.</p>

            <h3 id="markdown-header-hero">Hero</h3>
            <p>Heroes can move by one square each turn, and have the following attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <p>Life points (HP): Starting at the maximum value = 100.
                If HP drop to zero, the hero dies (see: <a href="#death-of-a-hero">Death of a hero</a>).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Gold: Starting at zero, this is the success indicator of the hero.
                At the end of the game, heroes will be scored based on their gold value.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="resolution-of-a-turn">Resolution of a turn</h3>
            <p>A bot must issue one order per turn.
            Possible orders are: Stay, North, South, East or West.
            Once the order is executed, the hero stays put, or moves one square in the given direction.
            If the hero:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <p>Tries to step out of the map, or over a tree, nothing happens.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Steps into a gold mine, he stays in place, and:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p>If the mine already belongs to the hero, nothing happens.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p>If the mine is neutral, or belongs to another hero,
                    a fight happens against the goblin guarding the mine.
                    The hero loses 20 life points. If he survives, the mine is his.</p>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Steps into another hero, he stays in place and nothing happens.
                Hero fights are resolved at the end of the turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Steps into a tavern, he stays in place and commands a beer.
                The hero pays 2 gold and receive 50HP. Note than HP can never exceed 100.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Times out, i.e. fails to send an order in the given delay (2 seconds),
                he stays in place until the game is finished. Note that he can still win if he as more gold than the other players at the end of the game.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>At the end of each turn, a few things happen:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fights</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Heroes are quite nervous and never miss an opportunity to slap each others with their big blades.
            After the hero has moved, if there is another hero at a distance of one square in any direction,
            then a fight is triggered. For instance, in this situation, after Hero 1 (<code>@@1</code>) has moved:</p>
            <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="err">@@</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="err">@@</span><span class="mi">2</span>
  <span class="err">@@</span><span class="mi">3</span>
            </pre></div>


            <p>A fight with Hero 2 happens.
            A fight with Hero 3 does NOT happen, because it is 2 squares far from Hero 1.
            The attacking hero doesn't loose any life point, the defending one, 20 points.
            If a hero dies (see: <a href="#death-of-a-hero">Death of a hero</a>), his opponent obtains control of all the loser's gold mines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The hero gains one gold per controlled mine</li>
                <li>The hero loses one HP (because all this action made him thirsty)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="death-of-a-hero">Death of a hero</h3>
            <p>When a hero HP drops to zero, he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuW6tQ0218">ceases to live</a>.
            The hero immediatly respawns somewhere on the map, with HP=100.
            The hero loses control of all his gold mines, but keeps all his amassed gold.</p>
            <p>A hero can't die of thirst. Thirst can put the hero HP to 1, but not to 0.</p>
            <h3 id="end-of-the-game">End of the game</h3>
            <p>The game ends when the maximum number of turns (usually 300) has been reached. The winner is the hero with the gratest amount of gold. If two players have the same amount of gold, there is no winner.</p>
            <h3 id="elo-rating">Rating</h3>
            <p>The rating system used is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">elo one</a>. Basically, it's better to be first than second, better to be second than third, and so on. You got the idea.</p>
